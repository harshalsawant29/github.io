  # About

    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/headshot.png"
    content: |-
      I’ve always been someone who loves diving into details, spotting patterns, and creating solutions that just make sense. My journey started in Mechanical Engineering, where I built a strong foundation in problem-solving. While participating in hackathons and tech events during my bachelor’s, I discovered a deeper passion—not just for logic and analytics, but for designing clean, intuitive interfaces that help users do more with less effort.

      That blend of engineering logic, visual thinking, and curiosity naturally led me into UI development. With 2+ years of hands-on experience and a Master’s in Information Technology and Management from Illinois Institute of Technology, I’ve worked on projects that bridge data and design—from interactive dashboards to front-end solutions that turn complex datasets into seamless user experiences.

      I’ve mentored interns, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and led frontend efforts where usability and performance mattered. Whether it's debugging a layout or refining a data-driven UI flow, I’m the one who says, “Let’s make this better.”
      
      Outside of work, you may find me on the soccer field, reading history books or listening to classical music.
